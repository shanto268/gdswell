# # Stackup
#
# A `Stackup` describes how the 2D layers in your layout extend into 3D — what
# material lives at what height, how its xy footprint morphs with z, and which
# entries override which. From the same `Stackup` you can currently produce either of two
# outputs:
#
# - **3D**: `stack.resolve(cell)` returns a `ResolvedStackup` describing how
#   each layer polygon should be extruded and cut against the others using a CAD tool.
# - **2D**: `stack.resolve_cutline(cell, cutline)` or
#   `stack.resolve_cross_section(cs)` returns a `ResolvedStackup2D` containing
#   the (already processed) 2D polygons of the cross-sectional view.
#
# Both outputs share the same minimalistic painter's-algorithm metadata: `mesh_order`,
# `keep`, and `cut_by`. This page works through both outputs on a small but
# realistic silicon-photonic stack: a rib waveguide with a TiN heater wired
# out to a metal pad.

# ## A silicon-photonic PDK
#
# A handful of layers is enough to express a complete rib-waveguide device.
# For the bulk media (Si substrate, buried oxide, oxide cladding) we use the
# smart `AllLayers().bbox()` recipe as the xy footprint: it expands at resolve
# time to the bounding box of every shape in the cell, so the bulk bodies
# automatically grow to enclose whatever the device draws — no dedicated
# "device extent" layer required.


# %%

    WG = (1, 0)  # full-Si rib (220 nm)
    SLAB = (2, 0)  # partial-etch Si slab (70 nm) under and beside the rib
    HEATER = (10, 0)  # TiN heater above the rib

# ## Building entries
#
# A `StackupEntry` is one logical 3D body. Currently this is a name plus a `z_to_layer` dict
# mapping absolute z values (µm) to `LayerBase` recipes (with room to expand to more intricate
# geometries).
# - The convenience constructor `StackupEntry.uniform(name, layer, zmin, zmax)` builds a 2-key
# entry with vertical sidewalls
# - Passing the dict directly lets you vary the
# xy recipe with z to produce slanted sidewalls or a topology that morphs
# between the keys.

# %%
# Bulk media — substrate, buried oxide, oxide claddings. All use the
# `AllLayers().bbox()` smart recipe, which resolves to the bounding box of
# every shape in the cell — so the cross-section will show them filling the
# whole frame regardless of what the device draws.
device_extent = gw.AllLayers().bbox()
substrate = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("Substrate", device_extent, -2.0, -1.0)
box = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("BOX", device_extent, -1.0, 0.0)
lower_clad = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("Lower_clad", device_extent, 0.0, 1.5)
upper_clad = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("Upper_clad", device_extent, 1.6, 2.5)

# Silicon: a 70 nm slab and the 220 nm rib that sits on top of it. The rib
# uses a 50 nm-per-side slanted sidewall via a z-varying recipe.
si_slab = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("Si_slab", PDK.SLAB, 0.0, 0.07)
si_rib = gw.StackupEntry("Si_rib", {0.0: PDK.WG, 0.22: PDK.WG.size(-0.05)})

# TiN heater, a via column, and a metal-1 pad.
heater = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("Heater", PDK.HEATER, 1.5, 1.6)
via1 = gw.StackupEntry("Via1", {1.55: PDK.VIA1, 2.5: PDK.VIA1.size(0.2)})

# %% [markdown]
# ## Composing StackupEntries into a Stackup with `+` and `-`
#
# `Stackup` composition is strict painter's order (left-to-right). `+` appends
# an entry with `keep=True`. `-` appends it with `keep=False`: this is used as
# a optional shortcut to
# indicate that an entity should participate in later `cut_by` computations, while not being
# emitted as an output volume. Use parentheses for explicit grouping when mixing the two.

# %%
stack = substrate + box + lower_clad + upper_clad + si_slab + si_rib + heater + via1 + metal1

# %% [markdown]
# ## Pretty-printing
#
# `print(stack)` renders the stackup as a table in painter's order. Uniform
# entries collapse to a single `zmin → zmax` row; z-varying entries get one
# row per z-key so slanted sidewalls and topology morphs stay visible (look
# at `Si_rib`).

# %%
print(stack)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inserting entries into an existing stackup

# It is sometimes useful to add entries to an existing stack instead of completely re-creating it.
# `insert_before(anchor, new)` and `insert_after(anchor, new)` return a new
# `Stackup` with `new` spliced next to the slot matching `anchor`, targeted by either entry
# name or a `StackupEntry` object (matched by equality).
# Passing a whole `Stackup` splices all of its items in at once. Setting `keep=False`
# turns everything inserted into a cutter (as if concatenated with "-"). For instance:

# %%
etch_stop = gw.StackupEntry.uniform("Etch_stop", device_extent, 1.5, 1.55)
print(stack.insert_after("Lower_clad", etch_stop))

# %% [markdown]
# An anchor must match exactly one target slot: an unknown anchor raises
# `ValueError`, and so does an ambiguous one (duplicate names are legal in a
# stackup, so silently picking a slot could corrupt painter's order). Passing
# the exact `StackupEntry` instead of a name is the way to disambiguate:

# %%
doubled = stack + si_rib  # a second "Si_rib" slot
try:
    doubled.insert_after("Si_rib", etch_stop)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Stack perturbations
#
# Both `StackupEntry` and `Stackup` are immutable: every perturbation returns a
# *new* object and leaves the original untouched. Perturbations come in two
# flavours — one acts on each entry's **xy layer recipes**, the other on its
# **z-keys** — and both compose cleanly through `+` / `-`, so you can perturb a
# sub-stackup and drop it straight into a larger composition.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Transforming layers (xy)
#
# The `map_layers(fn)` family rewrites the *recipe* side of every `z_to_layer`
# entry while leaving the z-keys fixed. `size`, `transformed`, `round_corners`,
# `bbox`, and the boolean selectors (`interacting`, `inside`, `outside`,
# `overlapping`) are exactly the [Smart Layer API](./12-smart_layers.py)
# operations from notebook 12, lifted onto a stackup: each one applies the
# corresponding `LayerBase` recipe transform to every entry. Calling one on a
# `Stackup` applies it to every entry in the stack.
#
# Here we grow both silicon layers by 100 nm per side — the recipes become
# `LayerSize(...)` wrappers while the z-keys stay put:

# %%
silicon = si_slab + si_rib
print(silicon.size(0.1))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Transforming z-keys
#
# `shift_z(dz)` translates every z-key; `scale_z(factor, origin=0.0)` scales
# them about a single shared absolute `origin`
# (`new_z = origin + (z - origin) * factor`). A negative `factor` mirrors the
# stack in z. On a `Stackup` both apply uniformly to
# all entries, so a sub-stackup moves or stretches as one rigid body.
#
# The motivating use is floating one sub-stackup in z relative to another. Here
# the silicon device is lifted 200 nm above the lower cladding — the `Si_slab` /
# `Si_rib` z-rows shift up while the bulk media stay put:

# %%
base = substrate + box + lower_clad
device = si_slab + si_rib
print(base + device.shift_z(0.2))

# %% [markdown]
# `scale_z` stretches thickness about the origin. Doubling the device about
# `z = 0` sends the slab top from 70 nm to 140 nm and the rib top from 220 nm
# to 440 nm:

# %%
print(device.scale_z(2.0))


# %% [markdown]
# ## Drawing the device
#
# Th stackup itself is only a recipe. To resolve it, we need a cell. Here, we make a
# device with a 20 µm-long rib waveguide with a TiN heater strip running along
# it; both ends of the heater fan out to a metal-1 pad south of the
# waveguide, contacted by a small via column.

# ## Resolving in 3D
#
# `Stackup.resolve(cell)` materialises each entry's xy regions at its own
# z-keys (no resampling) and emits one `ResolvedPrism` per slot. The
# downstream 3D backend is expected to consume the output and apply cuts in
# real 3D space, so `.resolve` itself does no 2D booleans — disjoint slots
# simply omit each other from `cut_by`.

# %%
resolved = stack.resolve(cell)
print(f"{'name':<12s}  {'order':>5s}  {'keep':>4s}  cut_by")
print("─" * 50)
for p in resolved.prisms:
    print(f"{p.name:<12s}  {p.mesh_order:>5d}  {str(p.keep):>4s}  {p.cut_by}")

# %% [markdown]
# `cut_by` is a forward-only list of slot indices whose 3D bbox overlaps this
# prism's; a 3D backend subtracts those entries' raw solids to obtain each
# kept prism's final volume.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Rendering the 3D stack with PyVista
#
# `gw.plot_stackup_3d(resolved)` builds one `pv.PolyData` per kept prism
# and returns a configured `pv.Plotter`. The viewer renders **raw** prism
# bodies — it does not apply `cut_by` subtractions, because robust 3D
# booleans on coplanar slab faces require exact-arithmetic CSG that VTK
# does not provide. Painter's-algorithm cuts are the downstream backend's
# job (e.g. meshwell); use this viewer for sanity-checking painter's order,
# layer footprints, and z-extents. The default `opacity=0.3` keeps bulk
# media (substrate, BOX, claddings) see-through so the rib, slab, heater,
# via, and metal-1 pad stay visible through them. `opacity_map` is the
# escape hatch for making specific prisms opaque.

# ## Cutting in 2D — `resolve_cutline`
#
# To get a 2D cross-section, pass a cutline (two xy points in microns)
# through the cell. The output `ResolvedStackup2D` carries per-entry
# `kdb.Region`s in the **(s, z) → (x, y)** convention: the region's x-axis
# is arclength `s` along the cutline; its y-axis is the stackup height `z`.

# vanish in the full-stack view next to micron-thick claddings.

# The bulk media (substrate, BOX, oxide claddings) fill the frame; on top of

#
# Later entries cut earlier ones where their 3D (or 2D) bboxes overlap.
# `plot_cross_section` applies these cuts by default (`apply_cuts=True`) so
# you see each prism's final, carved patch. Compare with `apply_cuts=False`,
# which renders the raw per-entry regions before any subtraction. This is useful
# to debug painter's order.

# ## Cutting in 2D — `resolve_cross_section`
#
# In many layouts, you usually already work with a `CrossSection`. The
# convenience `Stackup.resolve_cross_section(xs, s=0.0)` evaluates the

# ## Improvements
#
# This framework is extremely modular. We can add subclasses or keywords to StackupEntries to log
# information about more intricate geometries (e.g. filleted corners). We could also generate sets
# of StackupEntries
# from Stackup, for instance to emulate conformal claddings that calculate their effective
# footprints
# and levels from
# sets of StackupEntries in a Stackup. Alternatively, we could output "process" recipes for
# process simulation
# instead of already-rendered prisms.
